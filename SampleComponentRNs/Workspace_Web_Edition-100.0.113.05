[Premise]

Channels are now correctly displayed in the My Channels tab and status menu, and the agent Global Status tooltip is now correctly displayed after an agent logs in to Workspace.

Previously, in some specific scenarios, all channels were displayed as Out of Service in the My Channels tab and no channels or agent states were displayed in the Global Status tooltip in the Navigation bar. An example of a scenario which could cause the display issue is: an agent tries to login for the first time and the login operation fails, then the agent tries to login again and the login operation succeeds.

To force GWS to save the UserData of the parent email interaction to the child email interaction for Reply and ReplyAll operations, set the value of the "enableSaveEmailReplyUserDataToUCS" option to true. As a result, GWS sends AttachedData filled with the UserData of the parent interaction to UCS, and UCS can render the corresponding field codes in Standard Responses.
